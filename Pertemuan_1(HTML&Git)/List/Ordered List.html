            <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Discard the extra fat from the chicken and cut it into bite size pieces. Season with a little bit of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Peel and cut the carrot in rolling wedges (Rangiri) and cut the onions in wedges.
            </li>
            <li>Cut the potatoes into 1.5 inch pieces and soak in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
            <li>Grate the ginger and crush the garlic.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat and sauté the onions until they become translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger and garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and cook until the chicken changes color.</li>
            <li>Add the carrot and mix.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth (or water).</li>
            <li>Bring the stock to boil and skim the scrum and fat from the surface of the stock.</li>
            <li>Add the honey and salt and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>When the potatoes are ready, add the curry. If you use the store-bought curry roux, put 1-2 blocks of roux in a ladle and slowly let it dissolve with spoon or chopsticks. Continue with the rest of blocks. Then go to Step #17.
                If you are using homemade curry roux, add a ladleful or two of cooking liquid from the stock and mix into the curry paste. Add more cooking liquid if necessary and mix well until it’s smooth.</li>
            <li>Serve the curry with Japanese rice on the side and garnish with soft boiled egg and Fukujinzuke. You can store the curry in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days and in the freezer for 1 month. Potatoes will change the texture so you can take them out before freezing.</li>
